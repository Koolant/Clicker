# Clicker

This is a solution I built to fulfill the following user stories:

  I can input two time intervals and two screen coordinates.

  I can click a button that will return the x and y coordinates of the mouse cursor on the screen.

  I can click a button that will fire a mouse click at the chosen coordinates on the screen.

  After the first interval the location will be clicked again.

  After the second interval the location will be clicked again.

  I can check a box that will cause the first click to be a double-click.

  I can close the program and reopen it with state maintained.
  
  I can save and reload interval/coordinate combinations.

TODO: Maintain saved combinations between sessions.
